# template-practice-2

## Purpose
In creating this front in website I hope to focus on the following skills
- [Mobile first design](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud893/lessons/3494350031/concepts/35764085970923)
- Using [SMACSS[(https://smacss.com/) convensions in my CSS
- Using [backgrounds and gradients](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/setting-backgrounds-and-gradients/)

## Source Templates
I will be using these two templates as inspiration to guide my practice
- [This](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page218/oxygen) template because of its combined use of images and gradients for its background
